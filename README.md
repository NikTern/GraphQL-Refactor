# MERN Google Books Search

## Description

This is a MERN stack application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. The app has been refactored from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Users can save their favorite books, and the application features user authentication for personalized experiences.

The main purpose of this project was to refactor the code to implement a GraphQL API with Apollo Server, making the application more performant and scalable.

## Installation

To install the application, you can visit the deployed version on Heroku: [Heroku Link](https://graphqlrefactor.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

1. Register or log in to the application using the authentication form.
2. Search for books using the search bar.
3. Browse the results and save your favorite books by clicking the "Save" button.
4. View your saved books in the "Saved Books" section, where you can also remove books from your favorites list.
